\chapter{Conclusion}

Automatic story generation is an evolving domain that bridges artificial intelligence and creative writing, leveraging advancements in machine learning and natural language processing. This report has explored various methodologies, including neural sequence-to-sequence models, hierarchical generation approaches, event-based representations, human-AI collaboration frameworks, and AI-assisted evaluation mechanisms. Through the literature survey, we identified key developments that improve generation quality, creativity, and coherence while also highlighting persistent challenges in subjective evaluation and long-form storytelling.

Given the promising results demonstrated by event-based and graph-based approaches, this research will implement a model for automatic story generation that leverages structured event sequences and graph-based dependencies. This model aims to improve coherence, provide logical narrative structuring, and advance the capabilities of AI-generated storytelling. Future investigations will focus on refining these methodologies, enhancing scalability, and ensuring that generated narratives maintain compelling storytelling elements.

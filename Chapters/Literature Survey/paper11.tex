Introducing a graph-based event planning framework named NGEP \cite{tang_ngep_2022}, one study aimed to improve automated story generation, likely by enhancing story quality and potentially reducing repetition through structured event sequencing. This approach utilised an event schema designed to capture crucial actions and their associated roles, which were extracted from text using typed dependencies. The NGEP framework was evaluated in conjunction with different story generation models. Experiments were conducted using the ROC-Stories dataset, which contains human-written stories and was preprocessed, totalling 88344 stories in the training set. The performance was assessed using metrics including ROUGE, BLEU, diversity scores, and intra-story repetition. Results presented metrics such as intra-story repetitions for different event planning approaches. A notable challenge mentioned was the difficulty in reproducing a comparison method during evaluation. The provided sources did not explicitly detail other specific limitations of the NGEP framework itself.

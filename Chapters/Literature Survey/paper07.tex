Focusing on narrative comprehension and story completion, one line of research \cite{chen_incorporating_2019} aimed to enhance the ability of machines to predict story endings. This was approached by developing a neural story ending selection model that integrates three distinct types of information: narrative sequence, sentiment evolution, and structured commonsense knowledge. The motivation was to imitate how humans utilise both explicit story clues and implicit background knowledge to understand narratives. Experiments evaluating this model were conducted on the public ROCStory Cloze Task dataset. The reported results demonstrated that this approach outperformed state-of-the-art methods on the dataset, with the addition of commonsense knowledge yielding a significant performance gain. The provided sources do not explicitly detail specific limitations of this model.

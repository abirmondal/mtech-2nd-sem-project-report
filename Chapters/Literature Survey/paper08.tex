Aiming to enhance the quality of generated story text by expanding plot events into sentences, one study \cite{ammanabrolu_story_2020} proposed an ensemble-based system for the event-to-sentence problem. Their goal was to retain event tokens and enhance interestingness, addressing the limitation of simple language models that ignore input event details. The system utilised four distinct event-to-text models: a retrieve-and-edit model, a template filling model, a sequence-to-sequence with Monte Carlo beam decoding model, and a Seq2Seq with a finite state machine decoder, which were evaluated as an ensemble. Within their overall pipeline, a policy gradient deep reinforcement learner was used for event generation. The models were evaluated using a science fiction plot corpus containing over 1400 generalised stories with named entities replaced by tags. Experimental results indicated that the ensemble of models outperformed individual models, and the guided language generation system outperformed a baseline sequence-to-sequence approach. Specific limitations of this proposed method were not explicitly detailed in the provided sources.

Research in neural text generation often utilises the concept of sequence-to-sequence learning with neural networks \cite{sutskever_sequence_2014}. This approach, notably explored in foundational work like Sutskever et al. (2014), commonly employs encoder-decoder networks trained to predict an output sequence from an input sequence. These networks are recognised for their capability to learn relationships through paired sequences and serve as a basis for various text generation tasks, including automated story generation. The provided sources reference this work as a significant technique but do not detail the specific datasets, results, limitations, or explicit conclusions presented within the original Sutskever et al. (2014) publication.

Automatic story generation has gained significant attention with recent advances in AI and machine learning, offering new possibilities for creative writing while posing complex challenges. This report explores various approaches, including neural models, pre-trained language models (PLMs), event representations, human-AI collaboration frameworks, and AI-driven feedback mechanisms. Evaluating generated text presents unique difficulties due to subjectivity, requiring a combination of human assessments, automatic metrics, structured rubrics, and AI-assisted evaluations. Key findings highlight improvements in generation quality and diversity, validation of evaluation methods, and insights into human-AI creative workflows. The increasing influence of AI on storytelling brings opportunities for innovation but also raises challenges related to coherence, creativity, and ethical considerations, shaping the future of AI-assisted writing.
